# West Sound Chess Club

**Starting on November 17th, due to the latest temporary business closures, the club won't meet until our venue can open safely again.** Other than that, we usually meet Fridays 6pm-9pm at [Slaughter County Brewing Company](https://goo.gl/maps/MLYQGDA9BtWv36wX9) in Port Orchard, WA. Join the mailing list for updates and to get notified of cancelled meets!
